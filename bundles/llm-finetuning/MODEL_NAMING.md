# Model Naming and Quantization Reference

A field guide to the cryptic suffixes you'll see when browsing HuggingFace or
Unsloth for open-weight LLMs. If you've ever wondered what `gemma-4-E2B-it` or
`Qwen3-0.6B-unsloth-bnb-4bit-Q4_K_M.gguf` actually means, read this.

## The anatomy of a model ID

A model ID is a path: `{org}/{family}-{version}-{size}-{variant}-{quant}`.
Each segment is optional and ordering isn't strict, but this is roughly how
the HuggingFace ecosystem names things.

Example: `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit`

- `unsloth` — org hosting the weights (Google, Meta, Alibaba repackage under
  `unsloth/...` with Unsloth's pre-quantized variants)
- `gemma-4` — family + version
- `E2B` — size (see below)
- `it` — variant (instruction-tuned)
- `unsloth-bnb-4bit` — quantization

## Size suffixes

### Plain parameter counts

Most models advertise their parameter count directly:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `135M`, `360M` | millions of parameters (SmolLM2) |
| `0.5B`, `0.6B`, `1B`, `7B`, `70B` | billions of parameters |
| `1.5B`, `3B`, `8B`, `13B` | same, fractional |

Rule of thumb: **total VRAM ≈ params × bytes-per-param × 1.2 (overhead)**.
For fp16 that's 2 bytes/param; for 4-bit it's 0.5 bytes/param. A 7B model
needs ~17 GB in fp16 or ~5 GB in 4-bit for inference. Training adds gradient
and optimizer memory — roughly 4-6x the inference footprint for full
fine-tuning, or ~1.5x for LoRA/QLoRA.

### Gemma's "effective" notation (`E2B`, `E4B`)

Gemma 3n introduced **Matformer** — a nested transformer architecture where
a single weight file contains multiple sub-models at different scales. The
`E` prefix stands for **Effective**.

- `E2B` = behaves like a 2B parameter model for compute/latency, but the
  checkpoint contains more raw parameters (often 4-5B total). At inference,
  only the 2B "active" sub-network runs.
- `E4B` = 4B-equivalent compute from a larger checkpoint.

Why? You get the quality of a larger model's pre-training corpus and depth,
but pay only for the activated slice. Trade-off: the weight file on disk is
bigger than a plain 2B model, but runtime memory and latency match.

**Implication**: an `E2B` model fits the VRAM budget of a 2B model but often
outperforms it on quality benchmarks. Gemma 4 inherits this naming.

### "Mini", "Nano", "Small", "Medium", "Large"

Marketing suffixes for relative size within a family. No standard mapping —
check the model card. Phi-4-mini is ~3.8B; Qwen3-1.7B is sometimes called
"small"; Gemma-3n-E2B is "nano".

## Variant suffixes

These describe what kind of post-training the model has received on top of
the base pre-trained weights.

| Suffix | Meaning | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | Base model — raw next-token predictor | Pre-training continuation, research |
| `-it` | **I**nstruction-**t**uned (Google/Gemma convention) | Chat, task-following, fine-tuning target |
| `-Instruct` | Same as `-it`, different casing (Meta/Mistral/Qwen) | Same |
| `-Chat` | Chat-tuned with multi-turn format (older convention) | Conversational agents |
| `-DPO` | Direct Preference Optimization applied | Follows preferences, refuses harmful prompts |
| `-RLHF` | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback | Same, older pipeline |
| `-Thinking` | Trained to emit `<think>...</think>` before answers | Reasoning, math, complex tasks |

**For fine-tuning, always start from an instruction-tuned variant**
(`-it`/`-Instruct`). Base models require much more data and steps to learn
to follow prompts. The exception: if you want a model that only outputs a
specific format (e.g., JSON extractor), starting from a base model avoids
fighting the existing instruction-following behavior.

**"Thinking" models** deserve special attention. They're trained to output
a `<think>` block before their actual answer. At inference, you must either:

1. Give them enough `max_new_tokens` to finish thinking AND produce the
   answer (typical thinking blocks are 100-500 tokens), then strip the
   `<think>...</think>` block
2. Disable thinking mode via the tokenizer: `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
   messages, enable_thinking=False)` — Qwen3 and similar models support this

Fine-tuning a thinking model on short-answer examples (like classification
labels) teaches it to **skip thinking** entirely, which is usually what you
want for production.

## Tokenizer families and chat templates

Every model family has its own convention for formatting a multi-turn
conversation into a single token stream. You rarely write these tokens
yourself — `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages)` handles the formatting
— but you need to know which family your model belongs to because:

1. `get_chat_template()` in Unsloth takes a template **name** that must
   match the model
2. `train_on_responses_only()` needs the exact **instruction** and
   **response** delimiter tokens to mask correctly
3. Multimodal models use a **Processor** class with a different API than
   plain tokenizers

### Common chat template families

| Family | Models using it | Turn delimiters | EOS token |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ChatML** | Qwen2/3, SmolLM2, some Mistral, Nous | `<\|im_start\|>role\n ... <\|im_end\|>` | `<\|im_end\|>` |
| **Llama-3** | Llama-3.x | `<\|start_header_id\|>role<\|end_header_id\|>\n\n ... <\|eot_id\|>` | `<\|eot_id\|>` |
| **Gemma** | Gemma 1-4 | `<start_of_turn>role\n ... <end_of_turn>` | `<end_of_turn>` |
| **Gemma-4 internal** | Gemma 4 (Unsloth variant) | `<\|turn>role\n ... <turn\|>` | varies |
| **Llama-2 / Alpaca** | Llama-2, some older Mistrals | `[INST] ... [/INST]` | `</s>` |
| **Phi** | Phi-3, Phi-4 | `<\|user\|>\n ... <\|end\|>` | `<\|end\|>` |

ChatML is becoming the de facto standard for new open models because it's
simple, composable with system prompts, and maps cleanly to the OpenAI
message format. Llama and Gemma stuck with their own formats for historical
reasons.

### Masking for `train_on_responses_only`

When fine-tuning with TRL's SFTTrainer, `train_on_responses_only()` masks
instruction tokens so the loss is computed **only on the model's output**,
not on the prompt. To do that, it needs two strings:

```python
trainer = train_on_responses_only(
    trainer,
    instruction_part="<|im_start|>user\n",   # where a user turn starts
    response_part="<|im_start|>assistant\n", # where the assistant turn starts
)
```

These must **exactly match** the tokens your tokenizer emits. A single
wrong character (e.g., missing `\n`, extra space) and masking silently
fails — loss is computed over the whole sequence and training still runs
but produces a worse model. Always verify by tokenizing a formatted
example and checking which tokens end up with a real label vs. -100.

Common mask tokens by family:

| Family | `instruction_part` | `response_part` |
|---|---|---|
| ChatML (Qwen, SmolLM2) | `<\|im_start\|>user\n` | `<\|im_start\|>assistant\n` |
| Llama-3 | `<\|start_header_id\|>user<\|end_header_id\|>\n\n` | `<\|start_header_id\|>assistant<\|end_header_id\|>\n\n` |
| Gemma | `<start_of_turn>user\n` | `<start_of_turn>model\n` |

### Tokenizer vs. Processor

Most text-only models expose a `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`. Multimodal models
(Gemma 3n/4, Llava, Idefics, Qwen-VL) expose a **`Processor`** — a wrapper
that combines a tokenizer, an image processor, and sometimes an audio
processor. The two have **different APIs**, and code written for one will
silently break on the other.

**Differences that matter for text-only usage:**

```python
# Plain tokenizer (Qwen3, SmolLM2, Llama-3):
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, return_tensors="pt", add_generation_prompt=True,
)  # returns a torch.Tensor
inputs.to(model.device)
model.generate(input_ids=inputs, ...)

# Multimodal processor (Gemma-4):
prompt_text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True,
)  # returns a str, regardless of return_tensors!
inputs = processor(text=prompt_text, return_tensors="pt")  # must use text= kwarg
inputs = inputs.to(model.device)  # BatchFeature, has .to() method
model.generate(**inputs, ...)  # unpack because it has mm_token_type_ids etc.
```

Key gotchas:

1. **`apply_chat_template(..., return_tensors="pt")` returns `str`** on a
   processor, ignoring the `return_tensors` argument. You need a separate
   tokenization step.
2. **Processors require keyword arguments** — `processor(text=prompt)`
   works; `processor(prompt)` treats the first positional argument as
   `images` and fails with confusing errors like `'str' object has no
   attribute 'to'` or `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`.
3. **`BatchFeature` (processor output) has extra keys** like
   `mm_token_type_ids`, `pixel_values`, `attention_mask`. Use
   `model.generate(**inputs, ...)` to forward them all, instead of pulling
   out `input_ids` individually.

If your `classify_batch`-style inference helper needs to support both, the
safest pattern is:

```python
prompt_text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True,
)
inputs = tokenizer(text=prompt_text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=False)
response = tokenizer.decode(
    output[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True,
)
```

This works for both plain tokenizers (which accept `text` as the first
kwarg) and multimodal processors.

### Verifying the template before training

When adding a new model to the demo, **always print one formatted example
before training**. Catch template and mask mismatches immediately:

```python
sample = formatted_dataset[0]["formatted_text"]
print(repr(sample))

# Check that the mask tokens actually appear in the formatted text
assert cfg["mask_user"] in sample
assert cfg["mask_model"] in sample
```

Five minutes of verification saves hours of debugging why loss doesn't
converge.

## Quantization suffixes

Quantization reduces weight precision to save VRAM and speed up inference.
Two ecosystems matter: **bitsandbytes (bnb)** for training, and **GGUF** for
llama.cpp inference.

### Training-time: bitsandbytes (bnb)

Unsloth pre-quantizes models for QLoRA training. These suffixes show up in
the HuggingFace repo name:

| Suffix | Meaning | VRAM savings | Quality impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | Full precision (bf16/fp16) | baseline | perfect |
| `bnb-4bit` | Standard bitsandbytes NF4 quantization | ~4x reduction | ~0.5% accuracy loss |
| `unsloth-bnb-4bit` | Unsloth's optimized 4-bit (dynamic quant of attention) | same as bnb-4bit | slightly better than standard bnb-4bit |

**Use Unsloth's variant when available** — it's strictly better than
standard `bnb-4bit` for the same memory cost. The `load_in_4bit=True` flag
in `FastModel.from_pretrained` selects these automatically if the variant
exists on HuggingFace.

**Caveat for tiny models (<300M params)**: 4-bit quantization can leave
tensors on the PyTorch `meta` device (uninitialized), causing
`NotImplementedError: Cannot copy out of meta tensor`. For models this
small, set `load_in_4bit=False` — they fit in fp16 anyway.

### Inference-time: GGUF (llama.cpp)

GGUF is the file format llama.cpp uses. A single `.gguf` file contains
weights, tokenizer, and metadata. Quantization is baked in at export time.

Naming: `unsloth.Q4_K_M.gguf` — the `Q4_K_M` is the quantization recipe.

| Name | Bits | Size (7B model) | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `F16` | 16 | ~13 GB | Max quality, "fp16" equivalent |
| `BF16` | 16 | ~13 GB | Same size, different float format |
| `Q8_0` | ~8 | ~7 GB | Near-lossless, ~1% quality loss |
| `Q6_K` | ~6 | ~5.5 GB | Great quality, ~2% loss |
| `Q5_K_M` | ~5 | ~4.8 GB | Good quality, balanced |
| **`Q4_K_M`** | ~4 | ~4 GB | **Recommended default.** Best size/quality ratio |
| `Q4_K_S` | ~4 | ~3.8 GB | Slightly smaller, slightly worse than K_M |
| `Q3_K_M` | ~3 | ~3.3 GB | Acceptable for chat, noticeable degradation |
| `Q2_K` | ~2 | ~2.8 GB | Last resort, quality drops significantly |
| `IQ2_XS` | ~2.3 | ~2.5 GB | "Importance quantization", better than Q2 |

The letter suffixes:
- **`_0`**: simple symmetric quantization
- **`_K`**: "K-quant" — uses different quantization scales per block
  (better than `_0`)
- **`_S`** / **`_M`** / **`_L`**: size variant within the same K-quant
  family (small/medium/large). Larger = higher quality, slightly bigger
- **`IQ`** prefix: "importance quantization" — newer, smarter quantization
  that allocates more precision to important weights. Better than the
  same-bit `Q` variants

**Rule of thumb for deployment:**

- **`Q4_K_M`** — default choice for consumer hardware. 4x smaller than fp16,
  usually indistinguishable from fp16 in blind tests for most tasks
- **`Q5_K_M` or `Q6_K`** — when you have a little more RAM and want better
  quality
- **`Q8_0`** — when quality matters most and you have the space
- **`Q3_K_M` or smaller** — only on very constrained devices; expect
  perceptible quality drops

Export a fine-tuned model to GGUF with:

```python
model.save_pretrained_gguf(
    "my-model",
    tokenizer,
    quantization_method="q4_k_m",  # or "q5_k_m", "q8_0", "f16", ...
)
```

## Picking a model for fine-tuning

Decision tree:

1. **How much VRAM?**
   - 8 GB → Gemma-4 E2B, Llama-3.2 1B, Qwen3 0.6B-1.7B
   - 16 GB → Phi-4-mini, Gemma-4 E4B, Qwen3 7B
   - 24 GB+ → Llama-3.3 8B, Qwen3 14B, larger Gemmas

2. **What's the task?**
   - Classification / extraction / structured output → any instruction-tuned
     model at the size tier that fits. Start with Gemma-4 E2B
   - Conversational / multi-turn → Llama-3 or Gemma-4 in the `-it` variant
   - Reasoning / math → Qwen3 or a thinking-capable variant (but still
     fine-tune to skip thinking for production)

3. **Variant?** Always `-it` / `-Instruct` unless you have a specific reason
   to start from a base model.

4. **Quantization for training?** Always `load_in_4bit=True` with QLoRA,
   except for models <300M params where 4-bit quantization may leave
   tensors on the meta device — use fp16 for those.

5. **Quantization for deployment?** `Q4_K_M` is the default; bump to
   `Q5_K_M` or `Q8_0` if quality matters more than size.
